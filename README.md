# Machinelearning
Self inplemented machine learning algorithms including KNN, Decisoin Tree, Perceptron,Stochastic Linear Regression, Random Forest and XGBoost.

The project worked on a Kaggle dataset with about 100 million train related data. The goal is to compare various machine learning models' performance on train ticket price prediction. Specific detailed paper can be viewed in project.pdf file.
